    "Blackboard Learn REST integrations begin at the Developer Portal. This is where you register REST Applications and get the ID, key, and secrets. In the portal, you can see which client systems are using the integrations. Signing up is free, and you can develop your integration at no cost. There may be cost involved in deploying your integration, but before that happens, you'll have to speak with us. To discuss deploying your application, please contact Blackboard at developers@blackboard.com. Before you can authenticate your project with Blackboard applications, you need to be a registered Blackboard developer.To register as a Blackboard developer:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to https://developer.blackboard.com/ and select Sign Up. Read and agree to the terms and conditions.\n",
    "2. Provide your email address, a password, your first name and last, and select the checkbox to prove you are human.\n",
    "3. Select Create Account and you're on your way.\n",

    "## Register Your Application\n",
    "For your application to work with Blackboard Learn, you must register it in the developer portal. When you register your application, you receive a unique key and secret. The key/secret combination is unique, identifies your application, and cannot be retrieved. You must write them down someplace safe and treat them as credentials. You use them as part of the process to authenticate your application with Blackboard Learn instances.\n",

    "With the My Applications tab highlighted, select the + (add) icon.\n",
    "Complete the required fields. The default developer group for your application is your name. You can change this later. For more information about developer groups, see Developer Groups, Site Quotas, and Rate Limits. Learn displays your application's name and description to Learn administrators when they connect your application to their system. This helps them make sure they have found the intended application.\n",
    "The following fields are required:\n",
    "for REST applications, provide only a Name and Description for your application and select a Group to work on the project.\n",
    "for LTI 1.1 tools, provide Name, Description, Domain(s), and Group.\n",
    "for LTI 1.3 tools, complete all fields.\n",
    "Select Save. The portal displays your applications key and secret.\n",
    "Copy your key and secret and keep them safe.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. On the REST API Integrations page, select Create Integration.\n",

    "2. Select Browse next to Learn User. Search through the list of Blackboard Learn users to find the user that the integration should act as. Typically, an integration acts as Administrator or some other user created for integration management. Ideally, the user has only the permissions that the integration needs to function properly.\n",
    "3. For third-party integration, set End User Access to Yes. End users will sign in with their own Blackboard Learn ID to use the integration. Each user's access is then limited to his or her own permissions. If you set End User Access to No, the integration always has access as if it were the Blackboard Learn user indicated on the form.\n",
